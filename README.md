# LNU_1DT305_ReHydrator
IoT project for the Applied IoT summer course at Linnaeus University. Prototype for a smart water monitor (ReHydrator) using a HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, a DHT-11 temperature and humidity sensor and a Pycom microcontroller. The main objective of the ReHydrator is to keep track of oneâ€™s water intake (especially during hot days) and warn you in case you have not drunk enough. Sensor data is sent to the Ubidots platform and visualized on a Dashboard.
